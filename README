README file

To execute the "Colabdnn.ipynb" file, kindly click on the 'Open in Colab' button located in the upper left corner of the file interface. This action 
will initiate the notebook in Google Colab, allowing you to interact with and run the code within the notebook.

The code within "Colabdnn.ipynb" presents a thorough process that encompasses data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization 
utilizing TensorFlow and Keras. The code investigates diverse model configurations and determines the most effective setup by minimizing the Mean 
Squared Error (MSE). This project was crafted as a component of an Introduction to AI course, employing Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, and 
Matplotlib within the Google Colab environment. The principal objective was to construct regression models and visualize their predictive outcomes. 
The dataset employed in the project was provided by Dr. Ludwig, the course instructor.
